    <h2>Joshua Brazell</h2>
    <p>I am 25 years old, my wife and I have been married for almost a year and it has been great! 
        <p>We both served a mission for The Church in Portugal and that is how we met. For the last four years I was living in Denver and moved back to help my parents, since then we really wanted to get back in to some school and here we are. Currenlty pursuing a degree in Applied Technology with a little dose of pulling my hair out because computers are not my stong suite. </p>
        <p>I really like to tinker and build stuff and thought I should get in to some design classes. </p>
